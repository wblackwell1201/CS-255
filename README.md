The client, DriverPass, wanted to design a system to help people pass their drivers test through online learning and driver training. I feel I understood what the system should do and how the data should flow. My difficulties lied in recognizing all of the objects aside from the people involved. I made mistakes in my classes and objects diagrams. I would choose to redo them to understand them and to make sure my diagrams are done to completion.
The user's needs are the requirements for the system by default. If you do not create a system that does what the customer needs then it is useless. I interpreted the customer's needs through diagrams of processes, objects and classes, sequences, and use cases. I also, gathered information for the business and system requirements from the meetings at the beginning of the course. The Agile methodology is a great way to approach a project of any type. especially software. All of the diagrams and methods of intel gathering I learned were perfect for software design projects.
